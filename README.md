Simple hello world app
I am in my 4th incarnation, ie reinvention of self. I have been an IT manager in the financial sector, and have worked as a systems
analyst, product manager & product owner. I am a returning student at Seattle Central College to learn web development - end to end. 
I'm taking "full stack" seriously and want to be able to not only design and build, but also manage the infrastructure - hence my
enrollment in NTI300.
